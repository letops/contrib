DJANGO
======

In this directory there are multiple generic implementations to use with the
basic django installation.

Authentication
--------------

To be able to use the `authentication.py` file, you must install
`django_sendgrid_parse >= 0.4.0` because it replaces the emails sent for some
transactional emails from Sendgrid.
